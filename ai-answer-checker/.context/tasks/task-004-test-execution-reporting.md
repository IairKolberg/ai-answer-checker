# Task: TASK-004 - Test Execution & Reporting

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [ ] Active
- [ ] Completed

## Description
Implement test orchestration and reporting functionality to execute test suites and generate comprehensive reports.

## Objectives
- [ ] Execute test suites sequentially from configuration
- [ ] Collect and aggregate test results
- [ ] Generate console output with progress indicators
- [ ] Create detailed test reports (JSON/HTML)
- [ ] Return appropriate exit codes for CI/CD
- [ ] Handle test execution errors gracefully

## Dependencies
- TASK-001 - Configuration loading
- TASK-002 - HTTP client
- TASK-003 - Response comparison

## Implementation Steps
1. Create test orchestrator in `runner.py`
2. Implement test execution loop
3. Add progress reporting and logging
4. Create report generation functionality
5. Add CLI integration for output options
6. Implement proper exit code handling

## Technical Considerations
- Sequential vs parallel test execution
- Test isolation and cleanup
- Memory management for large test suites
- Interrupt handling (Ctrl+C)
- Test timing and performance metrics
- Error recovery and continuation

## Files to Modify
- `ai_answer_checker/runner.py` - Main orchestration logic
- `ai_answer_checker/reporting.py` - Create report generator
- `ai_answer_checker/cli.py` - Add output options
- `ai_answer_checker/models.py` - Add result models
- `tests/test_runner.py` - Add tests

## Report Formats to Support
- **Console**: Real-time progress and summary
- **JSON**: Machine-readable results for CI/CD
- **HTML**: Human-readable detailed reports
- **JUnit XML**: Integration with test frameworks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Executes all tests from configuration file
- [ ] Shows real-time progress during execution
- [ ] Aggregates pass/fail statistics
- [ ] Generates summary report to console
- [ ] Saves detailed results to output file
- [ ] Returns exit code 0 for success, 1 for failures
- [ ] Handles test execution interruption gracefully

## Python-Specific Requirements
- [ ] Follow PEP 8 style guide
- [ ] Add type hints for all functions
- [ ] Include comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Use logging framework for output
- [ ] Handle signals properly (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- [ ] Memory efficient for large test suites
