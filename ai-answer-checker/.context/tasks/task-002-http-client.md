# Task: TASK-002 - Basic HTTP Client

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [ ] Active
- [ ] Completed

## Description
Implement HTTP client functionality to communicate with AI agent endpoints based on configuration.

## Objectives
- [ ] Send HTTP requests to AI agent endpoints
- [ ] Support different HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- [ ] Handle authentication headers and custom headers
- [ ] Support JSON and form data request formats
- [ ] Implement timeout and retry logic
- [ ] Capture full response data (status, headers, body)

## Dependencies
- TASK-001 - Configuration loading must be completed

## Implementation Steps
1. Create HTTP client class in new module `http_client.py`
2. Implement request methods with timeout handling
3. Add authentication and header support
4. Implement retry logic for failed requests
5. Add response parsing and error handling
6. Integrate with runner orchestration

## Technical Considerations
- Use `requests` library for HTTP operations
- Configurable timeouts and retry policies
- Handle different content types (JSON, text, binary)
- Network error handling and recovery
- SSL certificate validation options
- Rate limiting support

## Files to Modify
- `ai_answer_checker/http_client.py` - Create HTTP client
- `ai_answer_checker/models.py` - Add request/response models
- `ai_answer_checker/runner.py` - Integrate HTTP client
- `tests/test_http_client.py` - Add tests
- `requirements.txt` - Add requests dependency

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Successfully sends HTTP requests to configured endpoints
- [ ] Handles authentication headers correctly
- [ ] Supports JSON and form data payloads
- [ ] Implements configurable timeout (default 30s)
- [ ] Retries failed requests (configurable, default 3 times)
- [ ] Captures complete response data
- [ ] Handles network errors gracefully

## Python-Specific Requirements
- [ ] Follow PEP 8 style guide
- [ ] Add type hints for all methods
- [ ] Include comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Use context managers for resource management
- [ ] Implement proper exception hierarchy
- [ ] Add logging for debugging
