# Task: TASK-003 - Response Comparison

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [ ] Active
- [ ] Completed

## Description
Implement response comparison logic to validate AI agent responses against expected results.

## Objectives
- [ ] Compare actual vs expected responses
- [ ] Support multiple comparison methods (exact, substring, regex)
- [ ] Handle different response formats (JSON, text, XML)
- [ ] Generate detailed comparison results
- [ ] Support custom validation rules
- [ ] Provide clear pass/fail determinations

## Dependencies
- TASK-002 - HTTP client must be completed to have responses to compare

## Implementation Steps
1. Create comparison engine in `comparison.py`
2. Implement different comparison strategies
3. Add JSON-specific comparison logic
4. Create detailed diff reporting
5. Add custom validation rule support
6. Integrate with test execution flow

## Technical Considerations
- Handle different data types and formats
- Performance for large responses
- Memory efficient diff algorithms
- Configurable comparison sensitivity
- Partial matching and fuzzy comparison
- Nested JSON structure comparison

## Files to Modify
- `ai_answer_checker/comparison.py` - Create comparison engine
- `ai_answer_checker/models.py` - Add comparison models
- `ai_answer_checker/runner.py` - Integrate comparison logic
- `tests/test_comparison.py` - Add tests
- Sample config files - Add comparison examples

## Comparison Methods to Support
- **Exact Match**: Byte-for-byte comparison
- **Substring**: Check if expected text is contained in response
- **Regex**: Pattern matching with regular expressions
- **JSON**: Structure-aware JSON comparison
- **Custom**: User-defined validation functions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Supports exact string comparison
- [ ] Supports substring matching
- [ ] Supports regex pattern matching
- [ ] Handles JSON response comparison
- [ ] Generates detailed diff reports
- [ ] Returns clear pass/fail status
- [ ] Handles edge cases (null, empty responses)

## Python-Specific Requirements
- [ ] Follow PEP 8 style guide
- [ ] Add type hints for all functions
- [ ] Include comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Use appropriate data structures for efficiency
- [ ] Handle encoding issues properly
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
