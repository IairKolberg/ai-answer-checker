# Session 2024-12-28 - Project Initialization

## Context Rules Reminder
Load `.context/context-rules.md` for Python-specific guidelines.

## Tasks Worked On
- Initial setup of .context directory structure
- Creation of Python-specific context rules and templates

## Summary
Initialized the AI context management system for the ai-answer-checker Python project. Created a complete directory structure with Python-specific adaptations of the rules from the Kotlin-focused .ai-context system.

## Files Modified
- `.context/context-rules.md`
  - Changes: Created Python-specific version of context rules
  - Purpose: Establish Python development guidelines and best practices
  - Python-specific notes: Added PEP 8, type hints, pytest, and Python package management guidelines

- `.context/documents/README.md`
  - Changes: Created directory documentation
  - Purpose: Explain the purpose and usage of the documents directory

- `.context/plans/README.md`
  - Changes: Created directory documentation  
  - Purpose: Explain the purpose and usage of the plans directory

- `.context/sessions/README.md`
  - Changes: Created directory documentation
  - Purpose: Explain the purpose and usage of the sessions directory

- `.context/tasks/README.md`
  - Changes: Created directory documentation
  - Purpose: Explain the purpose and usage of the tasks directory

- `.context/templates/README.md`
  - Changes: Created directory documentation
  - Purpose: Explain the purpose and usage of the templates directory

- `.context/templates/task.md`
  - Changes: Created Python-specific task template
  - Purpose: Provide consistent structure for task documentation
  - Python-specific notes: Added type hints, PEP 8, testing, and dependency management sections

- `.context/templates/session.md`
  - Changes: Created Python-specific session template
  - Purpose: Provide consistent structure for session logging
  - Python-specific notes: Added code quality, dependencies, and Python-specific considerations

- `.context/templates/decision.md`
  - Changes: Created Python-specific decision template
  - Purpose: Provide consistent structure for decision documentation
  - Python-specific notes: Added Python ecosystem and compatibility considerations

- `.context/templates/pr-list.md`
  - Changes: Created Python-specific PR list template
  - Purpose: Provide structure for breaking down features into reviewable PRs
  - Python-specific notes: Added linting, type checking, testing, and dependency management checklists

- `.context/create-project.md`
  - Changes: Created project setup documentation
  - Purpose: Document the project structure and setup requirements

- `.context/plans/plan1.md`
  - Changes: Created initial implementation plan
  - Purpose: Define the roadmap for implementing core functionality

- `.context/plans/tasks-list.md`
  - Changes: Created comprehensive task breakdown
  - Purpose: Define specific tasks for implementing the AI Answer Checker functionality

## Decisions Made
- **Use Python-specific adaptations**: Adapted the Kotlin-focused rules to Python development practices
  - Context: Original rules were designed for Kotlin systems
  - Impact: Provides Python-relevant guidelines for PEP 8, type hints, pytest, and package management
  - Alternatives Considered: Using original rules as-is, but they wouldn't be relevant for Python development

- **Include comprehensive Python best practices**: Added extensive Python-specific checklists and guidelines
  - Context: Python has specific conventions and tools that should be followed
  - Impact: Ensures code quality and consistency across the project
  - Python considerations: PEP 8, type hints, testing with pytest, virtual environments, dependency management

## Technical Findings
- **Directory Structure**: Successfully created the required .context directory structure with all subdirectories
  - Details: Created documents/, plans/, sessions/, tasks/, and templates/ directories
  - Implications: Provides organized structure for AI-assisted development

- **Template Adaptation**: Successfully adapted templates for Python development
  - Details: Added Python-specific sections for type hints, testing, linting, and dependency management
  - Python impact: Templates now guide developers to follow Python best practices

## Code Quality Notes
- Linting status: All markdown files follow consistent formatting
- Documentation: Comprehensive README files created for each directory
- Structure: Follows the established pattern from .ai-context system
- Python considerations: All templates include Python-specific best practices

## Dependencies
- No new Python packages added in this session
- Virtual environment: Working within existing project structure
- Templates reference common Python tools: pytest, flake8, mypy, black

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementing TASK-001 (YAML Configuration Loading)
2. Set up comprehensive testing framework
3. Start working through the implementation plan
4. Create first real task files using the new templates

## Questions to Resolve
- Should we add additional Python-specific templates (e.g., for API documentation)?
  - Context: FastAPI is used in the project for the stub server
  - Impact: Could improve API documentation consistency
