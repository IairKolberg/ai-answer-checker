# Implementation Plan 1: AI Answer Checker Core Functionality

## Overview
Implement the core functionality for the AI Answer Checker CLI tool, focusing on the runner module and test orchestration capabilities.

## Phase 1: Core Runner Implementation
**Timeline**: Priority 1
**Dependencies**: None

### Tasks
1. **TASK-001**: Implement YAML configuration loading
   - Parse test configuration files
   - Validate configuration structure
   - Handle configuration errors gracefully

2. **TASK-002**: Create HTTP client for agent communication
   - Implement HTTP client with timeout handling
   - Add support for SSE (Server-Sent Events)
   - Include retry logic and error handling

3. **TASK-003**: Develop response comparison logic
   - Compare AI agent responses
   - Support multiple comparison methods
   - Generate detailed comparison reports

## Phase 2: CLI Enhancement
**Timeline**: Priority 2
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion

### Tasks
4. **TASK-004**: Enhance CLI interface
   - Add more command-line options
   - Improve help and usage information
   - Add configuration validation commands

5. **TASK-005**: Implement test reporting
   - Generate test result reports
   - Support multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, text)
   - Include detailed pass/fail information

## Phase 3: Testing and Quality
**Timeline**: Priority 3
**Dependencies**: Phase 1-2 completion

### Tasks
6. **TASK-006**: Comprehensive testing
   - Unit tests for all modules
   - Integration tests for CLI
   - Mock testing for HTTP client

7. **TASK-007**: Code quality improvements
   - Add type hints throughout
   - Improve error handling
   - Add comprehensive logging

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Maintain compatibility with current dependencies
- Consider adding pytest-asyncio for async testing
- May need additional HTTP libraries for advanced features

### Performance
- Implement connection pooling for HTTP client
- Add caching for repeated requests
- Consider parallel test execution

### Security
- Validate all input data
- Secure handling of API keys and credentials
- Implement request/response logging controls

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] CLI can load and validate YAML configurations
- [ ] HTTP client successfully communicates with agent APIs
- [ ] Response comparison generates accurate results
- [ ] Test reports are comprehensive and useful
- [ ] Code follows Python best practices
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with simple implementations and iterate
- Use established libraries for HTTP and YAML handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling early
- Create integration tests to catch issues early
