user_input: "Why was I charged $160 after taxes this pay period?"

expected_answer: |
  You were charged $160 after taxes because a new post-tax deduction labeled "Student Loan Payment" was applied this period. Your gross pay and pre-tax deductions (HSA and Dental) are unchanged from the previous period, and taxes stayed the same. The $160 post-tax item directly reduced your net pay this period compared to last period.
