expected_answer: |
  Your gross pay and pre-tax deductions (Medical $125.00 and 401(k) $138.46) are the same in both periods. However, payroll tax withholding can vary period-to-period due to rounding, YTD thresholds, or changes in withholding logic. In your case, federal, Social Security, Medicare, and CO state taxes adjusted slightly, and the combined effect resulted in a lower net pay this period even though salary and pre-tax deductions stayed the same.
