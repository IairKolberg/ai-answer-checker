expected_answer: |
  The line item "Company Car (BIK): $300.00" is a taxable benefit-in-kind added this period. It increases your total taxable pay from $3,461.54 to $3,761.54, which leads to higher withholdings for federal, Social Security, Medicare, and state taxes. Your pre-tax deductions (Vision Insurance $30.00 and 401(k) $126.92) stayed the same, so the change in take-home is driven by the added taxable benefit and the resulting increase in taxes.
