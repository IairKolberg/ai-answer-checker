user_input: "How did my 401(k) and health insurance affect my paycheck?"

expected_answer: |
  Your 401(k) and health insurance are pre-tax deductions, so they reduce the income that is taxed before withholdings are calculated. In the current period, $243.08 was taken out pre-tax ($143.08 for 401(k) and $100.00 for health insurance); in the previous period, $226.92 was taken out pre-tax ($126.92 for 401(k) and $100.00 for health insurance). This lowers your taxable wages, which is why the increases in taxes and net pay are smaller than the increase in gross pay.
