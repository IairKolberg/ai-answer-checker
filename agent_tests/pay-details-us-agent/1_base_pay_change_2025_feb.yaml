user_input: "Why is my net pay higher this period?"

expected_answer: |
  Your net pay is higher this period because your gross pay increased significantly compared to the previous pay period. Gross pay rose from $1,200.00 to $2,346.15 (+$1,146.15), which led to higher tax withholdings across the board (federal, state, Social Security, and Medicare). There are no benefits deductions or reimbursements in this period, so all reductions are taxes.
