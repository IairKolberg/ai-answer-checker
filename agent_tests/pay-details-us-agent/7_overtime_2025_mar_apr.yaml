expected_answer: |
  Although your hours (and gross pay) doubled from 40 to 80, your net pay did not double because payroll taxes and contributions are not strictly linear. Federal, state, Social Security, and Medicare withholdings increased with the higher earnings, reducing the take-home rate on the additional income. Your pre-tax ($75.00 medical) and post-tax ($20.00 charity) deductions stayed flat, so they have less proportional impact at the higher gross, while progressive and proportional taxes drive a higher withholding share of the extra pay.
