  The $25.00 line labeled "Gym Reimbursement" is a post-tax reimbursement. Unlike pre-tax benefits, it does not reduce your taxable wages and appears after taxes are calculated. You can see it present in both periods as a post-tax item. In contrast, your 401(k) contributions and Commuter (Transit) are pre-tax deductions ($61.54 + $50.00 previously; $123.08 + $50.00 currently), which reduce the income subject to federal and state taxes before withholding.
